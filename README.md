# Life Safety Cloud  
🌐 Decentralized help. Human. Offline. For everyone.

---

## 🌱 Vision

In times of crisis, every second counts – yet people often lack access to electricity, the internet, or traditional emergency infrastructure.  
**LifeSafety Cloud** is an open, local platform built for exactly these moments:  
It empowers people to help each other decentrally, anonymously, and directly –  
from human to human, **without login, without surveillance, without central control**.

This platform is built on a simple idea:

> *“If there is no network – we become the network.”*

## 🛠️ What is LifeSafety Cloud?

LifeSafety Cloud is a concept for a decentralized emergency aid platform,  
designed to run locally on devices such as smartphones, laptops, Raspberry Pi, or other offline media.

The goal is to make **life-saving information**, **safe places**, **aid points**, **survival tips**, and **communication tools** available **offline** –  
even without internet, power, or servers.

## 💡 Features (in development)

- Offline-capable web app (e.g. via QR, USB, Bluetooth, SD card)  
- Platform-independent (Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, Pi, etc.)  
- Decentralized data storage (e.g. via IPFS or local JSON files)  
- Aid points & locations (submitted anonymously, shared offline)  
- Abuse prevention (e.g. photo verification, peer review, comment function)  
- Emergency guides & tutorials (e.g. build a generator, purify water, treat injuries)  
- No profit, no login, no tracking

## 📦 Status

This repository currently contains only the basic framework of the idea.  
Features, data models, and distribution paths are still in development.  

The vision is **publicly shared** to one day build a trustworthy, **human-first infrastructure** –  
**free, safe, ethical.**

---

## ⚠️ Why no server, no cloud, no company?

Because in real crises, those things may no longer exist.  
Power outage, war, floods, censorship, blackout – all of it shows:  
We need solutions that **still work when nothing else does**.

**LifeSafety Cloud** is meant to help when everything else fails.  
One small device running the platform could save lives.

## 🔐 License

**AGPL v3** – Every improvement remains free for everyone.  
No commercial use, no hidden integrations.

No community is active yet.  
This is the **first public step**.  

Later, the platform may grow openly –  
through developers, designers, helpers, people with heart.

## ❤️ Thank you for being here.

Maybe one day this platform will save a life.  
Maybe it helps you.  
Or maybe, in a dark hour, you’ll remember one simple truth:

> *“Humanity doesn’t need a network – only connection.”*
